This project is a comprehensive platform that seamlessly integrates three major components: a Library Management System for efficient book tracking and borrowing, a student academic platform that supports academic records and resources, and a social media platform to facilitate collaboration and communication among students. By offering an all-in-one solution, this project aims to enhance academic management and foster a connected student community, providing a streamlined, user-friendly experience for educational institutions.
